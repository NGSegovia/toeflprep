Detail Strategy
================

They use to start with "Acording paragraph 1..."

 1.Read the question 
 2.Identify the key words in the question
 3.Start reading quickly from the beginning of the paragraph in search of the key words or synonyms of them.
 4.60% of the answers will be found in the sentence with your key words. 30% will require you to read 1 sentence 
 5.Once you have read the sentence, check ALL the answer choices and choose the one that matches your anticipated answer best.

Carefull with the information not provided.


Negative Detail Strategy
========================

 They always possess within the question the words NOT or EXCEPT capitalized and in bold

 1.Read the question 
 2.Identify the key words in the question
 3.Start reading quickly from the beginning of the paragraph in search of the key words or synonyms of them.
 5.Once you have read the sentece, check ALL the answer choices that you can discard
 6.Read next sentence and get back to 5 until you have one option.


NOTE: If the key word is very common in the text, read the answers choices to select keywords


Inference Strategy
==================

These questions contains the words "infer, imply, or suggest"

Same strategy that detail, but consider that the answer is not going to be there explicity. You will need to educt it from the text.
Example: 30% of fruits are apples => 70% of fruits aren't.

Pronoum Strategy
================

Example: The word “them” in paragraph 4 refers to:

1)    Determine whether the pronoun is singular or plural.
2)    Identify all of the nouns in the sentence before the pronoun that match in number (singular or plural)
3)    Choose the one that fits the meaning of the sentence best.
4)    Find that noun among your answer choices and choose it.


Plug-in Strategy
================

Plug-ins ask you to place a sentence into one of four points in a paragraph

1) Find keywords from our plug-in phrase in the text. Discard very distanced options.
2) Check if the plugin phrase contains pronoums. If true try to match it with the other phrases.
3) Check if the plugin phrase has connecting adverbs. (however, therefore). Check the place where it matches.
4) Check if our plugin is general or specific. In academic English general sentences appear before specific sentences.







Purpose Strategy
================

This is a purpose question. We know this because it asks us why the author stated, mentioned, or said something. We remember our strategy and follow it.
It asks you why the author mentions or states a word, phrase, or sentence in the reading. 

1) Read the question to understand what you’re being asked. 
2) Identify the key words.
3) Read the appropriate paragraph and find those key words or synonyms of them.
4) Read the sentence with your key words and understand that the purpose of it is to explain the sentence that CAME BEFORE
5) Look for any adverbs that will help you to identify the relationship between the sentence with your key words and the sentence before it.
6) Choose an answer choice that reflects the information in the sentence before.

Summary Strategy
================

6 options and we need to mark 3.

1) Review the structure of the reading on your own by reminding yourself what each paragraph was about.
2) Read the summary question carefully and see if the sentence in bold gives you a clue as to what the answer choices might be.
3) Read your first answer choice to understand what it states and find its key words.
4) Scan through the reading until you find the key words or synonyms of them and read the sentences they are found in.
5) Determine whether that answer choice is a summary, detail, or wrong answer. Use the following method to do so.
	a. If an answer choice is a summary, the answer choice restates information found within the topic sentence of the paragraph, the first sentence. That’s a good choice.
	b. If the answer choice deals with a sentence that is not the first, it is a detail. It is therefore not a good choice. You must choose answers that summarize important points in the passage and not just minor points mentioned in one sentence that is not the topic sentence.
	c. If the answer choice describes content that is not found in the reading or is wrong according to the reading, of course, eliminate it.

6) After your analysis, you should be left with 3 summary answer choices. They will be your answers.
6a) If you are left with 4 summary answer choices, read the sentence in bold in the question and eliminate the answer choice that doesn’t directly deal with the topic sentence.
6b) If you are left with 2 summary answer choices and 2 detail answer choices, read the sentence in bold in the question and eliminate one of the detail answer choices that deals with the sentence in bold least.
