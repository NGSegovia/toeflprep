Main Idea Questions 
===================

It’s usually the first question that you’ll find after the listening and it has the word “mainly” in it.

1) Search your notes from the beginning. Identify the first topic brought up and determine if it was focused on throughout the notes that you have.
2a) If that topic is the major focus throughout your notes, then you have the focus of the listening and the main idea.
2b) If that topic is not the major focus throughout your notes, then you have to continue to scan your notes for a topic that is.
3) Examine your answer choices and choose an answer that fits what you have determined to be the main idea.

There are three general listenings you will get that will determine how you answer this question.

Type 1: Direct from the beginning.
  This is the easiest. The listening will start by introducing the topic in the first few sentences and then discuss it for the 
  rest of the lecture. The main idea here is easy: it’s the topic described in the beginning of the lecture.
Type 2: Change from the beginning
  This is a tricky one. This listening will begin by discussing a topic and then transition into a new topic. 
  So, if you just focus on the beginning and think that it represents the topic, you’ll be thrown off, feel confused, 
  and pick the wrong main idea answer.
Type 3: Confusing
  This main idea question comes from an uncommon listening; you're not going to find one as tough as this very often. 
  In this kind of listening, there is no definite description in the beginning. So, you must look at your overall notes 
  and notice the key concept that is repeated throughout. These types are tough because wrong answers can be very 
  appealing (which means attractive), but luckily for us, these are rare on the TOEFL and you're learning about them here.
