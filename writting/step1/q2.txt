In my opinion having a new movie theater in my neighborhood it's a nice idea and I can't find strong reasons to not support that.

First, It will be great to have some fun close to our place so you don't need to go so far for entertaiment. But not only for us, teenagers in the neighborhood who want to have fun wouldn't need to take public transport to other parts of the city, staying in a more safe and controlled environment so their parents can react really fast if a problem arises. They can also make more inner friendship since the don't get diseminated over the city. 

Second, it will be a source of jobs for the comunity. Unemployed pleople will have an oportunity to get a job rigth there. For example as cashiers, decorators, maintenance workers, etc. But now only directly working for the movie theater; it's easy so guess that other business will open close to this place, for example restaurants, banks, stores so the effect over the unemployment rate in the neighborhood can have an
mayor decrease.

Third, I consider it is one of the least disturbing or noisy activity. Cinemas used to have a great acoustic isolation in order to provide good sound for the movies. Other activities like night clubs, bowling places can be a big problem for the neighbors, specially if they are openend till late in the night.
