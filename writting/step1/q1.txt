From the lecture we identify some points that don't agree with the sentences in the passage.

First he drop doubts about the threatment of the animals in the zoos. We can find in the news some cases of animals died in zoos, because they had poison. The lecture supports that the zoo administrators don't take too much care about the animal's condiditions.

Second, he understands that zoos are just an entertaiment and not an educational value and gives some reasons: They only bring animals that are nice or popular to get more visitors, they show us that is ok to use animals for our own entertaiment and it can be an high valuable educational training since the animals are in an artifical environment, just to be exhibited.

Finally about endangered animals he supports that this has been done in a very small number of cases. Also to achieve the recuperation of endangenerd animal thay abuse of coupling animals of the same family which increases genetic deffects. He thinks that they could do a better job if they spent the same resources in the native habitat of the endangered animals.
